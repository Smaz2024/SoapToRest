    This file is the CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) bean deployment descriptor.
    Its presence in the WEB-INF directory enables CDI for this web application archive (WAR).
    It is used to configure how the CDI container discovers and manages beans.

           The 'bean-discovery-mode' attribute controls which classes are considered beans by the CDI container.
           - "all": The container scans every class in this archive. Any class that meets the implicit
             bean requirements becomes a managed bean. This is simple but can impact startup performance,
             especially in large applications.
           - "annotated": (Recommended for better performance) The container only processes classes that have a
             bean-defining annotation (e.g., @ApplicationScoped, @RequestScoped, @Inject).
           - "none": CDI is disabled for this archive.
